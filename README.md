👋 Hi there, I'm Md Yousuf Uddin!
🚀 About Me
I'm a curious developer with a strong foundation in C and C#, always eager to explore new horizons in software development. My current journey is taking me deep into the exciting realms of Game Development and UI/UX Design. I believe that great software isn't just functional, but also intuitive and delightful to use.

👨‍💻 Currently honing my skills in C and C#.
🎮 Driven by a passion for creating immersive and interactive game experiences.
🎨 Fascinated by the art and science of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, striving to make digital products user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
🖥️ My Expertise
Beyond coding and design, I bring a strong background in 3D modeling, visualization, and graphic design:

Product Modeling & 3D Visualization: Experienced in creating detailed 3D models and realistic visualizations.
3D Software Proficiency: Expert in using 3ds Max and Maya for modeling and rendering, and Substance Painter for high-quality texturing.
Graphic Design: Proficient in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for creating stunning visual content, branding, and marketing materials.
✨ What I'm Currently Working On
You'll find me dabbling in:

C/C# Projects: Exploring data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming.
Game Development Concepts: Experimenting with game engines (e.g., Unity with C#) and foundational game logic, often integrating my 3D modeling skills.
UI/UX Design Principles: Learning about wireframing, prototyping, user research, and design tools to enhance user interaction.
Advanced 3D & Graphic Design Projects: Continuously refining my skills in complex product modeling, photorealistic rendering, and digital illustration.
🌱 I'm Learning & Growing
I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and knowledge. My current learning focus includes:

Advanced topics in Game Development (e.g., graphics programming, AI for games).
Deep dives into UI/UX best practices and accessibility.
Exploring frameworks and tools that bridge the gap between robust code and beautiful design.
Integrating 3D assets and graphic design elements seamlessly into interactive applications and games.
